Vacancy Shadow Liability (VSL)

This project models vacant property as a public fiscal liability.

It estimates:
1. Direct public costs attributable to vacancy
2. Foregone property tax revenue due to delayed or suppressed use

The goal is to make vacancy legible to municipal finance, budgeting,
and housing strategy discussions.
